# this project consists of MySQL, python, html, and bootstrap. you're able to register where youre required to fill out the form and if not you're not able to register and flash messages would appear. Once you're registered, all the information you've put into the form is saved in the database with the help of MySQL- hashing the password however. Once you're registered you're able to login which, again requires you to fill out the form and flash messages would appear if it's not filled out. When you login it redirects to the dashboard where you'll find a table with all the recipes that have been added, not just the ones you add. You're able to view the instructions of each recipe and if you're the one who added the recipe you're able to delete it and edit it. there's a "add new recipe" button that redirects you to a different page that where you have to fill out a form- again, it's required to fill out the form; flash messages would appear if not filled out.  there's also a logout buttom that allows you to end the session.
